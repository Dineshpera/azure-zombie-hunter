# Azure Zombie Hunter 🧟‍♂️

Stop burning cash on dead resources.

azure-zombie-hunter is an open-source utility that scans your Azure subscription for "zombie" resources—unattached managed disks, idle public IPs, and orphaned network interfaces—that are silently inflating your cloud bill.

Features:

🚀 Instant Scan: Identifies unattached Managed Disks immediately.

🐳 Docker Ready: Run it anywhere with a single command.

🔒 Secure: Runs locally using your Azure CLI credentials. No keys stored.
